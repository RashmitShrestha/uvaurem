MY NOTES:
1. Eishenowher matrix constructor
   For each task, can have option of choosing one of the 4 squares in the Eishenowher matrix to classify its importance and urgency

2. Change the buttons for cutomization vs the buttons for setting the timer
      because if user wanted to change aesthetic, without changing the timer, then this change should be made
